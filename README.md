# Deconstructing Monetary Policy Transmission

This project analyzes the channels and effectiveness of monetary policy transmission using macroeconomic indicators. The analysis decomposes how policy rate changes affect inflation, output, and other key variables over time.

## 📘 Overview
The study aims to:
- Examine the short- and long-run impacts of monetary policy actions.
- Identify the most significant transmission channels (interest rate, credit, exchange rate, and asset price).
- Provide data-driven insights on the effectiveness of policy interventions.

## 🧩 Methodology
- **Data Source:** [Specify source — e.g., RBI Database, World Bank, or FRED]
- **Techniques Used:** Time Series Analysis, VAR/VECM models, Granger Causality Tests, Impulse Response Functions
- **Programming Language:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Results

The analysis revealed that the interest rate channel remains the most dominant mechanism in transmitting monetary policy effects to the real economy.
Changes in the policy rate significantly influenced inflation and output growth with a measurable time lag.
The credit and exchange rate channels also contributed to transmission but with comparatively weaker and delayed responses.
Impulse response analysis confirmed that contractionary monetary policy leads to a short-term decline in output followed by gradual stabilization in prices.

## 🧠 Future Scope

The study can be further extended in several directions to enhance its analytical depth and policy relevance:

+ Post-Pandemic Dynamics: Examine how the transmission mechanisms evolved during and after the COVID-19 period.

+ Nonlinear Modeling: Incorporate advanced econometric techniques such as Threshold VAR (TVAR) or GARCH models to capture regime shifts and volatility effects.

+ Cross-Country Comparison: Compare India’s monetary transmission process with other emerging economies to identify structural differences.

+ Machine Learning Integration: Explore hybrid statistical–machine learning models for improved prediction and interpretability of policy effects.

+ Sectoral Decomposition: Assess differential impacts across key sectors such as banking, manufacturing, and services.
